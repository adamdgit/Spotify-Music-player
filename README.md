# Spotify Clone - React

This project was created using Create React App by Adam Demol. 2022

## Using The App

Using this app requires your account to be added to a whitelist on my Spotify developer page. Unfortunately I can't grant access to everyone. If you wish to have access I need your Spotify email to add to the whitelist.

The app uses the official Spotify web API which can be read about below:
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/

Any changes within the app will be reflected on your Spotify account.

## What data is used?

No data is stored or tracked, you will be giving the app access to authorisation scopes for the functionality to work.

See the official documentation below: 
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/scopes/

## What can the app do?

- Modify playlist name, description and private/public options
- Add new songs
